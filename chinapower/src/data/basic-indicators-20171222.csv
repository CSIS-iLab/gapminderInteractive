life_expectancy,Indicator,Life Expectancy,,,y,1,1990,2015,,,,,,Years,,,,"Life expectancy is a key social development indicator that provides an important summary of mortality conditions within countries. China has made considerable strides in raising the average life expectancy across the country from 69.3 years in 1990 to 76.1 years in 2015. Despite this increase of 6.8 years, life expectancy in China still falls 3.5 years short of the average of 79.6 years found in high-income countries. <a href=""https://chinapower.csis.org/life-expectancy/""> Learn more.</a>",,,,,1,,,ARG;IND;JPN;ZAF;USA

Since 1990, China has dramatically reduced child mortality, from 53.9 deaths per 1,000 live births to 9.9 in 2016. This rate is still higher than the average for high-income economies (5.84 deaths), but significantly lower than its neighbors like India (43 deaths) and Pakistan (78.8 deaths).
